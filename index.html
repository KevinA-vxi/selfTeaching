        <h2>Why Make This Site?</h2>
        <p>I'm making this site because I need to learn more about actual web-design and front end programming. I have a deep passion for solving problems, but had a difficult time getting into coding initially because I couldn't see why programming was important for someone like myself.</p>
        <h3>My Realization</h3>
        <p>Coding is a wonderful art form where solving problems is the foundation, and if you have the perseverance to find answers to the problems in your life; coding will be a powerful tool in making computers deliver the solutions!</p>
